# README

This is a simple Ruby on Rails app. The app shows albums and their respective tracks once you click on the album. 
This is simply a portfolio project. 
If you would like to run the project, clone the repository, run bundle install and use rails s -p 4001(or whichever port you prefer).

Bug Fixes: 
1. Fix on the homepage the odd lines on the bottom of the albums when you hover over them.
2. Fix the formatting on the track pages themselves. Tracks are in a pyramid form and not a list form. 

If you find any bugs or have questions please email augustshah@02pilot.com
